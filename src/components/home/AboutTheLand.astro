      South Texas contains an unparalleled diversity of extremely unique and
      heat-tolerant plants found nowhere else in the United States. Sadly, this
      richness is both underappreciated by most who live here and understudied
      by those in fields of science. Thornscrub Sanctuary hopes to change that.
      Through active conservation, education and the support of scientific
      research, Thornscrub Sanctuary is working to further the studies of this
      unique habitat as well as protect what for too long has been
      underappreciated and easily discarded. Known to most in the region only as
      "brush" but to many Native Americans as "The Gardens" (as in: "The Peyote
      Gardens") the Thornscrub habitat contains a mixture of desert and
      subtropical plants adapted to calcareous, Caliche soils that are the
      weathered remnants of a Cretaceous Ocean. A living soil crust covers the
      grond along with river-tumbled cobbles that have been transported by an
      ancient Rio Grande from rock-bodies 300 miles to the West. Plants like
      Peyote, Texas Ebony, Guajillo, Blackbrush and the edible Coma comprise
      elements of the "living skin" of this unloved but beautiful landscape.
